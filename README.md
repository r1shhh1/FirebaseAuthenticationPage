# FirebaseAuthenticationPage
  This project includes a login and register system using Firebase Authentication which can be reused by me fellow android developers.
  
  The motivation for making this system came to me when I found myself making login pages repeatedly for multiple projects and i realised it will help 
  me to make a system which can be reused by me as well as others and in this I'll be doing a tiny bit of contribution to the community.
  
# Build Status
  1.The project works using the "findViewById" method and includes the plugins- [id 'kotlin-android'],[id 'kotlin-android-extensions']
  2.Also since the project uses Firebase Authentication it uses the following dependencies - [('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:31.0.3')],['com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics']
  3.Again for the UI i have used the material UI but feel free to make changes and make it better 
  
# Framework  
  The project works on MVC architecture 
 
# Installation 
  For using this module user needs to make their own database in Firebase. Then connect the database with your appllication then add the corresponding 
  google-services.json file and you'll be good to go.
  
# Contribute
  I'll really appreciate any UI upgrade suggestions and contributions!
